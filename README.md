nook2016
========

The [nook2016](http://metameute.de/nook2016/)(Night Of Open Knowledge) is planned for 2016-11-11.
A german version of the cfp can be found under https://wiki.metameute.de/nook2016-cfp.
I hope to be holding a talk about [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and will use this repo for the slides.
